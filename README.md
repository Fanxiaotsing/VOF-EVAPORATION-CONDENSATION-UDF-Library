# FLUENT-VOF-EVAPORATION-CONDENSATION-UDF-Library
UDF Library for Modeling Evaporation and Condensation using VOF model in ANSYS-FLUENT

This user-defined subroutine library is written to (a) track two-phase cells in the orthogonal solution domain, and (b) to  model phase change phenomena like Evaporation/Condensation in the two-phase interface using Modified VOF model. 
Readers may refer to " Agarwal, D.K, Welch, S.W.J, Biswas, G., and Durst, F. 2004. Planer Simulation of Bubble Growth in Film Boiling in Near-Critical Water Using a Variant of the VOF Method", J. Heat Transfer, 126, pp. 1-11 " for understanding the sub-routines used in this code. Please cite this paper if you use this code and contact me at bharatbhushansharma15113@gmail.com if you need any clarification regarding this code. 

NOTE: 
1). This is a geometry dimension dependent code,
2). It is meant for 2D simulations only.
3). Properties used in this code are those mentioned in above referred paper.

PS: Most of the sub-routines are explained in the code itself.
